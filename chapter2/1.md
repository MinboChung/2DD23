# tsibble objects

TS data consists of measurements along its recorded time or relevant time.
The data are stored in `tsibble` object in R.

## The index variable

|Year|Observation|
|:-:|:-:|
|2015|123|
|2016|39|
|2017|78|
|2018|52|
|2019|110|

```{R}
y <- tsibble(
    Year = 2015:2019,
    Observation = c(123, 39, 78, 52, 110),
    index = Year
)
```
`tsibble` objects extend tidy dataframes (`tibble` objects) by introducing temporal structure. We have set the time series `index` to be the `Year` column, which associates the measurements (`Observation`) with the time of recording (`Year`).

For observations that are more frequent than once per year, we need to use a time class function on the index. For example, suppose we have a monthly dataset `z`:

```
z
#> # A tibble: 5 × 2
#>   Month    Observation
#>   <chr>          <dbl>
#> 1 2019 Jan          50
#> 2 2019 Feb          23
#> 3 2019 Mar          34
#> 4 2019 Apr          30
#> 5 2019 May          25
```

This can be converted to a `tsibble` object using the following code:
```
z |>
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(Month)) |>
  as_tsibble(index = Month)
#> # A tsibble: 5 x 2 [1M]
#>      Month Observation
#>      <mth>       <dbl>
#> 1 2019 Jan          50
#> 2 2019 Feb          23
#> 3 2019 Mar          34
#> 4 2019 Apr          30
#> 5 2019 May          25
```
First, the `Month` column is being converted from text to a monthly time object with `yearmonth()`. We then convert the dataframe to a `tsibble` by identifying the `index` variable using `as_tsibble()`. Note the addition of "[1M]" on the first line indicating this is monthly data.

Other time class functions can be used depending on the frequency of the observations.

|Frequency| Function|
|:-:|:-:|
|Annual|`start:end`|
|Quarterly|`yearquarter()`|
|Monthly|`yearmonth()`|
|Weekly|`yearweek()`|
|Daily|`as_date()`, `ymd_hms()`|
|Sub-daily|`as_date()`, `ymd_hms()`|

## The key variables

A `tsibble` also allows multiple TS to be stored in a single object. Suppose you are interested in a dataset containing the fastest running times for women's and men's track races at the Olympics, from 100m to 10000m:

```
olympic_running
#> # A tsibble: 312 x 4 [4Y]
#> # Key:       Length, Sex [14]
#>     Year Length Sex    Time
#>    <int>  <int> <chr> <dbl>
#>  1  1896    100 men    12  
#>  2  1900    100 men    11  
#>  3  1904    100 men    11  
#>  4  1908    100 men    10.8
#>  5  1912    100 men    10.8
#>  6  1916    100 men    NA  
#>  7  1920    100 men    10.8
#>  8  1924    100 men    10.6
#>  9  1928    100 men    10.8
#> 10  1932    100 men    10.3
#> # ℹ 302 more rows
```

The summary above shows that this is a `tsibble` object, which contains 312 rows and 4 columns. Alongside this, `[4Y]` informs us that the interval of these observations is every **four years**.

The 14 time series in this object are uniquely identified by the keys: the `length` and `sex` variables. The `distinct()` function can be used to show the categories of each variable or even combinations of variables:

```
olympic_running |> distinct(Sex)
#> # A tibble: 2 × 1
#>   Sex  
#>   <chr>
#> 1 men  
#> 2 women
```
## Working with `tsibble` objects

We can use `dplyr` functions such as `mutate()`, `filter()`, `select()` and `summarise()` to work with `tsibble` objects. To illustrate these, we will use the `PBS` tsibble containing sales data on pharmaceutical products in Australia.

```
PBS
#> # A tsibble: 67,596 x 9 [1M]
#> # Key:       Concession, Type, ATC1, ATC2 [336]
#>       Month Concession   Type    ATC1  ATC1_desc ATC2  ATC2_desc Scripts  Cost
#>       <mth> <chr>        <chr>   <chr> <chr>     <chr> <chr>       <dbl> <dbl>
#>  1 1991 Jul Concessional Co-pay… A     Alimenta… A01   STOMATOL…   18228 67877
#>  2 1991 Aug Concessional Co-pay… A     Alimenta… A01   STOMATOL…   15327 57011
#>  3 1991 Sep Concessional Co-pay… A     Alimenta… A01   STOMATOL…   14775 55020
#>  4 1991 Oct Concessional Co-pay… A     Alimenta… A01   STOMATOL…   15380 57222

#>  9 1992 Mar Concessional Co-pay… A     Alimenta… A01   STOMATOL…   16898 61108
#> 10 1992 Apr Concessional Co-pay… A     Alimenta… A01   STOMATOL…   18141 65356
#> # ℹ 67,586 more rows
```
This contains monthly data on Medicare Australia prescription data from July 1991 to June 2008. These are classified according to various concession types, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) indexes. For this example, we are interested in the `Cost` time series (total cost of scripts in Australian dollars).

We can use `filter()` function to extract the A10 scripts:
```
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |> # df |> filter(df.col1 == val1) |> select(col_x, col_x, col_y, col_z)
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost)
#> # A tsibble: 816 x 4 [1M]
#> # Key:       Concession, Type [4]
#>       Month Concession   Type           Cost
#>       <mth> <chr>        <chr>         <dbl>
#>  1 1991 Jul Concessional Co-payments 2092878
#>  2 1991 Aug Concessional Co-payments 1795733
#>  3 1991 Sep Concessional Co-payments 1777231
#>  4 1991 Oct Concessional Co-payments 1848507
#>  5 1991 Nov Concessional Co-payments 1686458
#>  6 1991 Dec Concessional Co-payments 1843079
#>  7 1992 Jan Concessional Co-payments 1564702
#>  8 1992 Feb Concessional Co-payments 1732508
#>  9 1992 Mar Concessional Co-payments 2046102
#> 10 1992 Apr Concessional Co-payments 2225977
#> # ℹ 806 more rows
```
This allows row of the tsibble to be selected. Net we can simplify the resulting object by selecting the columns we will need in subsequent analysis.

```
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost)
#> # A tsibble: 816 x 4 [1M]
#> # Key:       Concession, Type [4]
#>       Month Concession   Type           Cost
#>       <mth> <chr>        <chr>         <dbl>
#>  1 1991 Jul Concessional Co-payments 2092878
#>  2 1991 Aug Concessional Co-payments 1795733
#>  3 1991 Sep Concessional Co-payments 1777231
#>  4 1991 Oct Concessional Co-payments 1848507
#>  5 1991 Nov Concessional Co-payments 1686458
#>  6 1991 Dec Concessional Co-payments 1843079
#>  7 1992 Jan Concessional Co-payments 1564702
#>  8 1992 Feb Concessional Co-payments 1732508
#>  9 1992 Mar Concessional Co-payments 2046102
#> 10 1992 Apr Concessional Co-payments 2225977
#> # ℹ 806 more rows
```

The `select()` function allows us to select particular columns, while `filter()` allows us to keep particular rows.

Note that the index variable `Month`, and the keys `Concession` and `Type`, would be returned even if they were not explicitly selected as they are required for a tsibble (to ensure each row contains a unique combination of keys and index).

Another useful function is `summarise()` which allows us to combine data across keys. For examples, we may wish to compute total cost per month regardless of the `Concession` or `Type` keys.

```
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) |>
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost))
#> # A tsibble: 204 x 2 [1M]
#>       Month  TotalC
#>       <mth>   <dbl>
#>  1 1991 Jul 3526591
#>  2 1991 Aug 3180891
#>  3 1991 Sep 3252221
#>  4 1991 Oct 3611003
#>  5 1991 Nov 3565869
#>  6 1991 Dec 4306371
#>  7 1992 Jan 5088335
#>  8 1992 Feb 2814520
#>  9 1992 Mar 2985811
#> 10 1992 Apr 3204780
#> # ℹ 194 more rows
```
The new variable `TotalC` is the sum of all `Cost` values for each month.\
We can create new variables using the `mutate()` function. Here we change the unites from dollars to millions of dollars:

```
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) |>
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) |>
  mutate(Cost = TotalC/1e6)
#> # A tsibble: 204 x 3 [1M]
#>       Month  TotalC  Cost
#>       <mth>   <dbl> <dbl>
#>  1 1991 Jul 3526591  3.53
#>  2 1991 Aug 3180891  3.18
#>  3 1991 Sep 3252221  3.25
#>  4 1991 Oct 3611003  3.61
#>  5 1991 Nov 3565869  3.57
#>  6 1991 Dec 4306371  4.31
#>  7 1992 Jan 5088335  5.09
#>  8 1992 Feb 2814520  2.81
#>  9 1992 Mar 2985811  2.99
#> 10 1992 Apr 3204780  3.20
#> # ℹ 194 more rows
```

Finally, we will save the resulting tsibble for examples later in this chapter.

```
PBS |>
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") |>
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) |>
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) |>
  mutate(Cost = TotalC / 1e6) -> a10
```

At the end of this series of piped functions, we have to use a right assignment (`->`), which is not common in R code, but is convenient at the end of a long series of commands as it continues the flow of the code.

## Read a csv file and convert to a tsibble

Example:
```
prison <- readr::read_csv("https://OTexts.com/fpp3/extrafiles/prison_population.csv")

prison <- prison |>
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Date)) |>
  select(-Date) |>
  as_tsibble(key = c(State, Gender, Legal, Indigenous),
             index = Quarter)

prison
#> # A tsibble: 3,072 x 6 [1Q]
#> # Key:       State, Gender, Legal, Indigenous [64]
#>    State Gender Legal    Indigenous Count Quarter
#>    <chr> <chr>  <chr>    <chr>      <dbl>   <qtr>
#>  1 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           0 2005 Q1
#>  2 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           1 2005 Q2
#>  3 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           0 2005 Q3
#>  4 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           0 2005 Q4
#>  5 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           1 2006 Q1
#>  6 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           1 2006 Q2
#>  7 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           1 2006 Q3
#>  8 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           0 2006 Q4
#>  9 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           0 2007 Q1
#> 10 ACT   Female Remanded ATSI           1 2007 Q2
#> # ℹ 3,062 more rows

```

## The seasonal period

Some graphics and some models will use the seasonal period of the data. The seasonal period is the number of observations before the seasonal pattern repeats. In most cases, this will be automatically detected using the time index variable.

Some common periods for different time intervals are shown in the table below:

|Data|Minute|Hour|Day|Week|Year|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Quarters|||||4|
|Months|||||12|
|Weeks|||||52|
|Days||||7|365.25|
|Hours|||24|168|8766|
|Minutes||60|1440|10080|525960|
|Seconds|60|3600|86400|604800|31557600|

*More complicated (and unusual) seasonal patterns can be specified using the `period()` function in the `lubridate` package.

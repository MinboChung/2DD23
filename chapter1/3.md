# Determining what to forecast

## Determining forecasting needs
- Consider what should be forecasted: individual product lines or grouped products, specific sales outlets or regional groups.
- Determine the frequency of data required for forecasting: weekly, monthly, and annually.
- Decide the forecasting horizon: short-term (1 month), medium-term (6 months), or long-term (10 years).

## Choosing suitable methods
- Different forecasting horizons require different models.
- For frequent forecasts, consider automated systems over manual methods.

## Understanding user requirements
- Communicate with forecast users to grasp their needs and intended utilization of forecasts.
- Avoid extensive work until user needs are clearly understood.

## Data collection and preparation
- Identify and gather necessary data, which may already exist.
- Data could include sales records, historical product demand, or regional economic indicators.
- Organize and collate available data before deeloping forecasting methods.
- This process can be time-consuming for forecasters.

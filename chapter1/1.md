# What can be forecast?

## Lecture note

### What aren't forecast?
- **Hopecast** != Forecast
- Genuine attempt to predict what is going to happen in the future $\rightarrow$ The actual data and predicted data should be explanable.
- E.g. Common wealth prediction presented by Grattan analysts
  - The plots showed the forecasts in every year was way higher between actuals and predicts

### What can we forecast? (Easiest to hardest to forecast)
1. Time of sunrise this day next year
2. Timing of next Halley's comet appearance
3. Maximum temperature tomorrow
4. Daily electricity demand in 3 days time
5. Total sales of drugs in Australian pharmacies next month
6. Google stock price tomorrow
7. Exchange rate of US dollars and KR WON next week
8. Google stock price in 6 months time
9. etc...

### What makes something easy to forecast?

- Data and resource availability to advance understanding the factors to predict
- Good understanding in the domain for the prediction
- Low scope of uncertainty in prediction


## Note from passage below lecture

1. **Importance of Forecasting:** Forecasting is crucial for various decision-making processes like planning for future demand, staff scheduling, inventory management, and more. It aids effective and efficient planning across different time frames.

2. **Factors Affecting Forecasting:** Forecast accuracy depends on factors like understanding contributing factors, data availability, similarity of past and future conditions, and whether forecasts can influence the outcome.

3. **Predictability Varies:** Some events or quantities are easier to forecast due to a clear understanding of contributing factors and ample available data. However, forecasting becomes challenging when factors are not well-understood, future conditions are uncertain, or forecasts themselves influence the outcome.

4. **Examples of Forecasting Scenarios:** Residential electricity demand can be accurately forecasted due to well-understood contributing factors and ample historical data. Conversely, forecasting currency exchange rates is more challenging due to limited understanding of influencing factors, potential future changes, and the direct impact of forecasts on the rates.

5. **Market Efficiency and Self-Fulfilling Forecasts:** Efficient market hypothesis states that well-publicized forecasts can directly influence the outcome, making the forecasts themselves shape the predicted events, as seen in the case of exchange rates.

6. **Knowing Forecasting Limitations:** It's crucial to recognize when accurate forecasting is possible and when it's akin to chance. Good forecasts discern genuine patterns from random fluctuations in historical data.

7. **Adaptability in Changing Environments:** Forecasting models are designed to capture changing environments and assume that the way in which the environment is changing will continue into the future.

8. **Forecasting Methods:** Forecasting methods vary widely in complexity, from simple methods like using the most recent observation to highly complex models like neural nets and econometric systems. When no data are available, judgmental forecasting techniques come into play.

9. **Choosing a Method:** The choice of forecasting method depends on data availability and the predictability of the quantity to be forecasted.
